# Portfolio

I'm a determined person, ready to face always new challenges and to give all my efforts in them. I'm a goal oriented person and I'm convinced that a goal is better and easier reached with a smile on the face and having the right attitude towards people. I have skills and experience in the Administrative and Financial area with a strong inclination towards Reporting and Data Analysis. I'm developing a strong interest in Data Science and the use of AI tools. I'm always ready to take part into new experiences because I strongly believe that every lost occasion is a lost opportunity.

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my Achievements, skills, and certificates. It is updated on the regular basis.
